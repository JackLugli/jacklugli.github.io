Students were having trouble having their links show up on the md page if the links were in md. Here is an experiment of Julian's links. It turns out that if you view page source, GitHub changes the markdown language into html. The link below, written in md, shows up as an html link.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/JackLugli/jacklugli.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Here is a trial of student work on Timeline JS brought to md:

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
