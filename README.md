Students were having trouble having their links show up on the md page if the links were in md. Here is an experiment of Julian's links. It turns out that if you view page source, GitHub changes the markdown language into html. The link below, written in md, shows up as an html link.

Supposed I make it an image with an ! in front of it?

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/JackLugli/jacklugli.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Here is a trial of student work on Timeline JS that I placed in on the ReadMe page:

For a majority of my childhood, Barack Obama was the President of the United States of America. After this past unprecendented election, many Americans miss his presence in the Oval Office, so I decided to create a timeline of his very interesting and profound life. Check it out below!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
